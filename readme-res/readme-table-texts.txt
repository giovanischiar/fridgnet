--------------------------------------------------
The app starts with a blank screen; that's the 
`HomeScreen`. Let's click on the red button to 
add photos.
--------------------------------------------------
Thats's the image picker system screen, you can 
select one or multiple photos at once.
--------------------------------------------------
After selecting the photos, the app will search 
for the address where each photo was taken using 
its coordinates, group them by their cities, and 
show each city plotted on their own mini map.
--------------------------------------------------
You can also see them grouped by county, state, 
and country by clicking on the dropdown.
--------------------------------------------------
When you click on `Map` at the bottom tab it 
shows the `MapScreen`. It's the world map where 
all countries, states, counties, and cities in 
which every place the photos where taken is 
plotted together along with each photo.
--------------------------------------------------
The `PhotosScreen` is shown when you click on 
one mini map on Home Screen. The map of the city 
is plotted along with its photos on each 
coordinate, and there's a complete list of the 
photos below it.
--------------------------------------------------
Sometimes, there are locations that own exclaves. 
Take a look of San Francisco. As you can see, the 
Farallon Islands is part of San Francisco. 
However, the map becomes too small when including 
theses islands. To hide the islands on the map, 
go to `MapScreen` and click on the San Francisco 
territory.
--------------------------------------------------
This screen is the `PolygonsScreen`; it allows 
you to hide exclaves by clicking on the check on 
the upper corner of each map. you can uncheck 
one-by-one or click on `switch all` to check or 
uncheck all of them at once.
--------------------------------------------------
Now the `HomeScreen` shows the mini map of San 
Francisco without taking account those islands. 
Therefore, it shows bigger than before.
--------------------------------------------------
You can do it even with countries, counties or 
states, like for example, the United States. 
you'll be surprised how many overseas territories 
a country have.
